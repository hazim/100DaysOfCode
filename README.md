# 100DaysOfCode
A log for my 100 Days of Code

## Day 01
JavaScript Treehouse JavaScript Basic by Dave McFarland
parse Strings to Numbers 
In case you input number into a prompt command in JS it will still treat the input as a string. In order to be abole to run basic math operator on it we will have to convert it into a number using, the parse operator. parseInt() for intagers or parseFloat() for decimal numbers. In order for it to work it can not start with text

## Day 02
Math.random() for a number between 0 - 1 (upto but not including 1)
Math.floor() rounds the number down, towards the floor
Math.ceil() rounds the number up, towards the ceiling

## Day 3 
Today was completely focused on __Markdown__. This is such a useful tool. It gives me the power to revisit the previous two days note and amend them for if to be more useful. 

- * * / _ _ italic
- ** ** / __ __ bold
- ~~ ~~ strike through 
- t# 
- ##  
- [] for adding hyperlink for the text inside the square brackets 
- []() you put the hyperlink inside the brackets
- < > to transform the text inside into hyperlink 
- ( "") inside the quotation marks, you should place descripton information that shows up when you hver the text.
- [][]it is similar 
- ! []() 
- ``` ``` for creating blocks

## Day 06 

Did some tiding up with around here as I combined my two Markdown classes into a single cheat sheet.

Progresses with JavaScript and completed a section on
